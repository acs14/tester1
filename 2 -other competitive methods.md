Relatively speaking, the mains advantages of acoustic recovery are the lowered energy and compactness of the mechanism needed to dewater algae. In contrast more conventional means make use of huge centrifuges, or on chemical disturbance via flocculation, which utilises reagents and may change the character of the algae recovered. The algal density levels that can be obtained with the acoustic approach can reach â€¦g/L of dry biomass, although the many challenges that remain with the approach are speed, and throughput challenges. Here is a change to the document to see how well it's tracked.
